My name is [Eli](https://twitter.com/astrobiased) and I'm data scientist at
[Stitch Fix](http://technology.stitchfix.com/), leading the Data Labs division.
We're working on novel challenges with an amazing team. If you're interested in
what we do, check out Stitch Fix's [technology page](http://technology.stitchfix.com/).

I wrote a book on [SciPy and NumPy](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020219.do).
It covers the barebones of the two Python packages, which are
often used for numerical analysis.

Previously, I was an astrophysicist and researched how stars formed at
some great places like [Harvard](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/),
[ESO](http://www.eso.org/public/), [Exeter](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/),
and [CSIRO](http://www.csiro.au/).
