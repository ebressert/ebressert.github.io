My name is [Eli](https://twitter.com/astrobiased) and I'm data scientist at
[Stitch Fix](http://technology.stitchfix.com/), leading the Data Labs division.
It's a great place to be as we're working on awesome challenges with a team
that sets a high-bar.

I wrote a book on [SciPy and NumPy](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020219.do).
It covers the barebones of the two Python packages, which are
often used for numerical analysis.

Previously, I was and astrophysicist and researched how stars formed at
some great places like [Harvard](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/),
[ESO](http://www.eso.org/public/), [Exeter](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/),
and [CSIRO](http://www.csiro.au/).
