<p>In the 1942 Isaac Asimov published the first short story that would eventually lead to the Foundation Series. When reading the series today, it's evident that the book was written in a very different time where the concept of the Internet was unformed, hand held computers were a dream, and concepts of AI were in their infancy. But it struck a cord on something very interesting, data and statistics. </p><p>The series revolves around the collapse of a pan-Galactic empire and the efforts to minimize the damage on humanity through mathematical modeling called psychohistory. Psychohistory was developed by a mathematician named Hari Seldon and its function is to predict the the future of human society through statistical methods using historical data. Does this sound familiar? Data science!</p><p>The series is speckled with plausible and implausible feats of statistical feats, but it provides some great food for thought. Could we really do something like psychohistory?  </p><p><br></p>
