While I was a science imager for the [Chandra X-ray Observatory](http://chandra.harvard.edu/), [Thomas Robitaille](http://www.mpia.de/homes/robitaille/index.html) and I teamed up to make a **big** image of the Large Magellanic Cloud using [Spitzer Space Telescope](http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/) data from the [SAGE Survey](http://sage.stsci.edu/). It's a galaxy that's only 150,000 light years away from us. Trust me, it's close in astronomical terms. Why did we do it? To have some fun and placate our curiosity on what we could come up with.

Tom handled the data reduction along with some tricky image cleaning for science-grade results. I put the data through Python, Pixelmator, and Photoshop to make the color image, which Tom and I thought looked good. We never had the chance to share it publicly, so we're doing it now. Below you can peruse through the 16,000 x 16,000 pixel image of the Large Magellanic Cloud.

##The Twist: Find the beast and win a prize##
A few people ([Ryan](http://www.sciencesortof.com/about/about-ryan/), [Patrick](http://www.sciencesortof.com/about/about-patrick/), and I) thought it would be nice to throw in a golden egg in the image. Ever heard of the [Science ... sort of](http://www.sciencesortof.com/) podcast? If not, go over to their website and download a show. It's a great and entertaining podcast as the hosts chat about odd science topics over beer. They have a knowledgeable team of people who all have scientific backgrounds ranging from planetary science to the study of sloths. The podcast's motto is "[a] podcast about things that are science and things that are sort of science"

Science ... sort of's mascot is a strange looking beast called the Brachiolope. You can see an image of this on their [website's](http://www.sciencesortof.com/about/about-ryan/) header or their Brachiolope [gallery](http://www.sciencesortof.com/brachiolope-gallery/). This beast is placed somewhere in the Large Magellanic Cloud image above as a nebulous structure. If you find the Brachiolope and send [us](mailto:eli@astrobiased.com) a screen-shot of it, you may win a prize!

The prizes will range from a copy of my [SciPy and NumPy book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020219.do) to Science ... sort of goodies like a special edition astronomy-themed t-shirt or mug. Among those who send the screen-shot, we'll randomly select five winners. The winners will be selected and notified at the end of next week. Good luck in finding the Dark Brachiolope Nebula!
