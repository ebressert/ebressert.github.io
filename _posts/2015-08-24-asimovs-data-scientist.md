summary:    In 1942 Isaac Asimov published the first short story of many that would eventually lead to the Foundation Series. When reading the series today, it's evident that the book was written in a very different time where the concept of the Internet was unformed, hand held computers were a dream, and concepts of AI were in their infancy. But it struck a cord on something very interesting, data and statistics.

In 1942 Isaac Asimov published the first short story of many that would eventually lead to the [Foundation Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series).

When reading the series today, it's evident that the book was written in a very different time where the concept of the Internet was unformed, hand held computers were a dream, and concepts of AI were in their infancy. But it struck a cord on something very interesting, data and statistics.

The series revolves around the collapse of a pan-Galactic empire and the efforts to minimize the damage on humanity through mathematical modeling called psychohistory. It was developed by a mathematician named Hari Seldon and psychohistory's function in the story was to predict the future of human society through statistical methods using historical data. Does this sound familiar? Asimov created a character, Hari Seldon, that resembles our modern day data scientist!

The series is speckled with plausible and implausible feats of statistical predictions, but it provides some great food for thought. Could we really do something like psychohistory? I'd say yes on some fronts, but it's very sensitive to how granular the historical data is.
