For the last two days I have been at the [2013 Astroinformatics School](http://www.smp.uq.edu.au/anitaworkshop2013/?page_id=30) in Brisbane where PhD students and early career postdocs learned about programming. This ranged from coding practices, like version control, to visualizing big data.

My talks on scientific Python and plotting with Matplotlib were on the second and third day of the workshop, so I missed the first day. When I walked in to the workshop room on the second day, I was bit a shocked. There were ~70 people in the room (astronomy is small). I knew before hand there would be a lot attending and that the workshop was over subscribed, but seeing it in person was impressive.

The workshop's objective is to prepare the new generation of astronomers for the future. We're on the cusp of dealing with massive volumes of data where the [LSST](http://www.lsst.org/lsst/) will pull in 30 TB per day and the [SKA](http://www.skatelescope.org/) will pull in 300 TB per day. If we can, we will squeeze every possible drop of information from the data.

During the two days I was there, the components that caught my attention were SQL, citizen science, GPU processing with CUDA, Python for the web, and understanding computers/clusters in terms of speed and memory. They all had a common theme of analyzing and interfacing with big data problems. From the questions that the attendants asked, I sensed that everyone is thinking how to deal with the data deluge. Interesting times ahead.
