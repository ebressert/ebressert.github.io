In astronomy observational data comes in many flavors. Ranging from X-ray to radio wavelengths, data can be captured in either 2D images or higher dimension data cubes. For the Chandra X-ray telescope, the data can be observed in 4D space: x, y, energy, and time. For radio data you can get velocity x, y, and velocity (line-of-sight). In fact, that is just scratching the surface. There's a lot more information that can be gleaned from these datasets, but for now we will stick with that.

Visualizing data that has more than two dimensions is not easy, since it requires complex programming and is computationally taxing. In the medical field scientists and doctors visualize data on their patients in 3D frequently, e.g., MRI scans. A cool example is the [X Toolkit](https://github.com/xtk/X#readme) project, which is WebGL based. For astronomy, there are many packages that allow us to peruse 3D data such as [DS9](http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/site/Home.html), [CASA](http://casa.nrao.edu/), or [AstroMed](http://astromed.iic.harvard.edu/).

Recenly, another program has been making a splash in 3D visualization field: [yt](http://yt-project.org/). It generates amazing renderings of numerical simulations in +3D space and it's Python based. Here's some eye candy to see what it is capable of.

I have kept an eye on yt for a while, but never used it as I'm looking for ways to visualize **observational** data. After a quick chat with [Matthew Turk](https://sites.google.com/site/matthewturk/), the creator of yt, I realized that porting observational data cubes to yt is *very* easy. In yt there is a function called `load_uniform_grid`. Here's a quick example of how to load a [FITS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS) data cube into yt's data structure.

{% highlight python linenos %}
from yt.frontends.stream.api import load_uniform_grid
from astropy.io import fits

# Loading fits data
cube = fits.getdata('some_data_cube.fits')

# Porting the data cube structure to yt's data structure
data = dict(Density = cube)
pf = load_uniform_grid(data, cube.shape, 9e16)
{% endhighlight %}

From there you can start visualizing your data in data slices, volume rendering and much more. Here's a project rendering example of data (position, position, velocity map) on the nearby star-forming cloud, Perseus, from the [COMPLETE](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/COMPLETE/) survey.

{% highlight python linenos %}
from yt.imods import OffAxisProjectionPlot

# The vector normal to the slicing plane
L = [0.5, 0.2, 0.9]

# The command to generate the off axis projection plot
p = OffAxisProjectionPlot(pf, L, 'Density')

# Applying a grey colormap to all data
p.set_cmap(field='all', cmap='Greys')

# Saving the image
p.save()
{% endhighlight %}

The output here is less fancy than the two previous images and that's because there are many options to tweak in yt to make it look better. Matthew Turk, tried a quick run on this and came up with a nice 3D volume rendering. Here's the code and image output.

{% highlight python linenos %}
import numpy as np
from yt.mods import *
from yt.frontends.stream.api import load_uniform_grid
from astropy.io import fits
from aplpy.image_util import percentile_function

# Loading fits data
cube = fits.getdata('PerA_12coFCRAO_F_vxy.fits')

# Masking out nan elements
cube[np.isnan(d)] = np.nanmin(d)

# Loading data into yt structure
data = dict(Density = cube)
pf = load_uniform_grid(data, cube.shape, 9e16, nprocs=16)

# Custom min and max to show using function in APLpy.
# Haven't used APLpy yet? Check it out at aplpy.github.com.
auto_v = percentile_function(data['Density'])
mi, ma = auto_v(0.15), auto_v(99.95)

# Setting up parameters for volume rendering. See the following
# link for more details on the parameters:
# http://yt-project.org/doc/cookbook/simple_plots.html#cookbook-simple-volume-rendering
tf = ColorTransferFunction((mi, ma))
tf.add_layers(4, w=0.3)
c = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]
L = [0.5, 0.2, 0.9]
W = 1.0
Nvec = 512
cam = pf.h.camera(c, L, W, Nvec, tf)
image = cam.snapshot("%s_volume_rendered.png" % pf, 8.0)
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to see what other possibilities there are, then check out [yt's documentation](http://yt-project.org/doc/index.html). The cool thing about yt is that it now accepts any type of 3D data cube, including the observational astronomy data. But it has become something more. It has become a tool that can be used for **many** more 3D visualization purposes.
