In the last few weeks, there's been a lot of public attention focused on the PANSTARRS comet. It's now visible to the naked eye if you're in the [right place at the right time](http://blog.barentsen.be/2013/03/05/map-when-can-you-see-comet-panstarrs/). Sounds tricky right? Fortunately, one great piece of software called [Stellarium](http://www.stellarium.org/) that gives you a good idea of where to look based your location and time, visually. It couldn't get much easier. The downside is that comets are not installed with Stellarium by default. Below I will outline the steps needed to get Stellarium comet-friendly. If you don't have Stellarium, you can get it for **free** [here](http://www.stellarium.org/).

###Turning on the comet wisdom
Stellarium comes with a plugin installed to show you comet locations in the sky relative to where you are at any time. Here's how we do it. Go to *configuration window* > *solar system editor* > *options* > *configure* > *import orbital elements in MPC format* > *select the type* > *comets* > *select a source from the list* > *MPC's list of observable comets* and then hit *get orbital elements*. Then search for CL 2011 L4 (PANSTARRS). Got that? I'm impressed ;-). In case that was a bit too dense, here's a video.
